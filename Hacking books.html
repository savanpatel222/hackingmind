	<p>Circumvention is to “descramble a scrambled work…decrypt an encrypted work, or
otherwise…avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without
the authority of the copyright owner.” The legislative history provides that “if unauthorized
access to a copyrighted work is effectively prevented through use of a password,
it would be a violation of this section to defeat or bypass the password.” A “technological
measure” that “effectively controls access” to a copyrighted work includes measures
that, “in the ordinary course of its operation, requires the application of
information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of the copyright owner, to
gain access to the work.” Therefore, measures that can be deemed to “effectively control
access to a work” would be those based on encryption, scrambling, authentication, or
some other measure that requires the use of a key provided by a copyright owner to
gain access to a work</p>
